**Coqui STT** is an open-source Speech-To-Text engine, using a model trained by machine learning techniques based on `Baidu's Deep Speech research paper <https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.5567>`_. üê∏STT uses Google's `TensorFlow <https://www.tensorflow.org/>`_ to make the implementation easier.

**Documentation** for installation, usage, and training models are available on `stt.readthedocs.io <https://stt.readthedocs.io/>`_.

For the **latest release**, including pre-trained models and checkpoints, `see the latest release on GitHub <https://github.com/coqui-ai/STT/releases/latest>`_.
